# comment_genration
Training a bot to comment on current affairs. The comments on New York Times articles are very well written, rich in vocabulary and mostly grammatically correct, yet they are close to lay person's conversational language. This makes the dataset of 2 million comments on NYT articles a good candidate for generating automated comments.
